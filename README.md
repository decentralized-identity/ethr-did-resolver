# ethr DID Resolver

This library is intended to use ethereum addresses as fully self managed [Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#decentralized-identifiers-dids) and wrap them in a [DID Document](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#did-documents)

It supports the proposed [Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) spec from the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io).

It requires the `did-resolver` library, which is the primary interface for resolving DIDs.

The DID method relies on the [ethr-did-registry](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry).

## DID method

To encode a DID for an Ethereum address, simply prepend `did:ethr:`

eg:

`did:ethr:0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74`

## DID Document

The did resolver takes the ethereum address, checks for the current owner, looks at contract events and builds a simple DID document.

The minimal DID document for a an ethereum address `0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74` with no transactions to the registry looks like this:

```js
{
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/did/v1',
  id: 'did:ethr:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a',
  publicKey: [{
       id: 'did:ethr:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a#owner',
       type: 'Secp256k1VerificationKey2018',
       owner: 'did:ethr:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a',
       ethereumAddress: '0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a'}],
  authentication: [{
       type: 'Secp256k1SignatureAuthentication2018',
       publicKey: 'did:ethr:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a#owner'}]
}
```

Note this uses the `Secp256k1VerificationKey2018` type and an `ethereumAddress` instead of a `publicKeyHex`.

## Building a DID document

The DID document is built by using read only functions and contract events on the [ethr-did-registry](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry) Ethereum smart contract.

Any value from the registry that returns an ethereum address will be added to the `publicKey` array of the DID document with type `Secp256k1VerificationKey2018` and an `ethereumAddress` attribute containing the address.

### Owner Address

Each identity always has an owner address. By default it's the same as the identity address, but check the read only contract function `identityOwner(address identity)` on the deployed version of the EthrDIDRegistry contract.

The Identity owner will always have a `publicKey` with the id set as the DID with the fragment `#owner` appended.

An entry is also added to the `authentication` array of the DID document with type `Secp256k1SignatureAuthentication2018`.

### Enumerating contract events for an identity

The `EthereumDIDRegistry` contract publishes 3 types of events for each identity.

- `DIDOwnerChanged`
- `DIDDelegateChanged`
- `DIDAttributeChanged`

If a change has ever been made for an identity the block number is stored in the `changed` mapping.

The latest event can be efficiently looked up by checking for one of the 3 above events at that exact block.

Each event contains a `previousChange` value which contains the block number of the previous change (if any)

To see all changes in history for an identity use the following pseudo code:

1. call `changed(address identity)` contract
2. if result is null return
3. filter for events for all the above types with the contracts address on the specified block
4. if event has a previous change then go to 3

### Delegate Keys

Delegate Keys are ethereum addresses that can either be general signing keys or optionally also perform authentication.

They are also verifiable from solidity (see [ethr-did-registry](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry) for more info).

A `DIDDelegateChanged` event is published that is used to build a DID.

```solidity
event DIDDelegateChanged(
    address indexed identity,
    bytes32 delegateType,
    address delegate,
    uint validTo,
    uint previousChange
  );
```

The only 2 delegateTypes that are currently published in the DID Document are:

- `veriKey` Which adds a `Secp256k1VerificationKey2018` to the `publicKey` section of document
- `sigAuth` Which adds a `Secp256k1SignatureAuthentication2018` to the `publicKey` section of document. An entry is also added to the `authentication` section of document.

**Note** The `delegateType` is a `bytes32` type for Ethereum gas efficiency reasons and not a string. This restricts us to 32 bytes, which is why we use the short hand versions above.

Only events with a `validTo` in seconds greater or equal to current time should be included in the DID document.

### Non Ethereum Attributes

Non ethereum keys, service elements etc can be added using attributes. Attributes only exist on the blockchain as contract events of type `DIDAttributeChanged` and can thus not be queried from within solidity code.

```solidity
event DIDAttributeChanged(
    address indexed identity,
    bytes32 name,
    bytes value,
    uint validTo,
    uint previousChange
  );
```

**Note** The `name` is a `bytes32` type for Ethereum gas efficiency reasons and not a string. This restricts us to 32 bytes, which is why we use the short hand attribute versions below.

While any attribute can be stored. For the DID document we currently support adding to each of these sections of the DID document:

- [`Public Keys`](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#public-keys)
- [`Service Endpoints`](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#service-endpoints)

### Public Keys

The name of the attribute should follow this format:

`did/pub/(Secp256k1|RSA|Ed25519)/(veriKey|sigAuth)/(hex|base64)`

#### Hex encoded Secp256k1 Verification Key

A `DIDAttributeChanged` event for the identity `0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74` with the name `did/pub/Secp256k1/veriKey/hex` and the value of `0x02b97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71` generates a `PublicKey` entry like this:

```js
{
  id: "did:ethr:0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74#delegate-1",
  type: "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",
  owner: "did:ethr:0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74",
  publicKeyHex: '02b97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71'
}
```

#### Base64 encoded Ed25519 Verification Key

A `DIDAttributeChanged` event for the identity `0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74` with the name `did/pub/Ed25519/veriKey/base64` and the value of `0xb97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71` generates a `PublicKey` entry like this:

```js
{
  id: "did:ethr:0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74#delegate-1",
  type: "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
  owner: "did:ethr:0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74",
  publicKeyBase64: "uXww3nZ/CEzjCAFo7ikwU7ozsjXXEWoyY9KfFFCTa3E="
}
```

We are looking for people to submit support for `pem`, `base58` and `jwk` key formats as well.

### Service Endpoints

The name of the attribute should follow this format:

`did/svc/[ServiceName]`

#### Hex encoded Secp256k1 Verification Key

A `DIDAttributeChanged` event for the identity `0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74` with the name `did/svc/HubService` and value of the url `https://hubs.uport.me` hex encoded as `0x68747470733a2f2f687562732e75706f72742e6d65` generates a `Service` entry like this:

```js
{
  type: "HubService",
  serviceEndpoint: "https://hubs.uport.me"
}
```

## Resolving a DID document

The resolver presents a simple `resolver()` function that returns a ES6 Promise returning the DID document.

```js
import resolve from 'did-resolver'
import registerResolver from 'ethr-did-resolver'

registerResolver.default()

resolve.default('did:ethr:0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74').then(doc => console.log)

// You can also use ES7 async/await syntax
const doc = await resolve.default('did:ethr:0xf3beac30c498d9e26865f34fcaa57dbb935b0d74')
```
